This policy explains what information we collect when you use Medium ’ s sites , services , mobile applications , products , and content ( “ Services ” ) .
It also has information about how we store , use , transfer , and delete that information .
Our aim is not just to comply with privacy law .
It ’ s to earn your trust .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
So we don ’ t collect data in order to advertise to you .
The tracking we do at Medium is to make our product work as well as possible .
This includes basic product functions like allowing our metered paywall to work and key features like personalizing what posts you see based on what we think you ’ ll like .
So , to give you the best possible experience in using Medium , we collect information from your interactions with our network .
Some of this information , you actively tell us ( such as your email address , which we use to track your account or communicate with you ) .
Other information , we collect based on actions you take while using Medium , such as what pages you view ( including how much of a given page and for how long ) and your use of product features ( like highlights , follows , and applause ) .
This information includes records of those interactions , your Internet Protocol address , information about your device ( such as device or browser type ) , and referral information ( how you got to a particular page ) .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
We use this information to : ; provide , test , improve , promote and personalize the Services ; fight spam and other forms of abuse ; generate aggregate , non-identifying information about how people use the Services

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
When you create your Medium account , and authenticate with a third-party service ( like Twitter , Facebook , Apple or Google ) we may collect , store , and periodically update information associated with that third-party account , such as your lists of friends or followers .
We will never publish something through one of your third-party accounts without your express permission .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
Medium won ’ t transfer information about you to third parties for the purpose of providing or facilitating third-party advertising to you .
We won ’ t sell information about you to a third-party .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
We may transfer your account information with third parties in some circumstances , including : ( 1 ) with your consent ; ( 2 ) to a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards ; ( 3 ) with academic or non-profit researchers , with aggregation , anonymization , or pseudonymization ; ( 4 ) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law , such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process ; ( 5 ) when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help prevent imminent harm to someone .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
If we are going to share your information in response to legal process , we ’ ll give you notice so you can challenge it ( for example by seeking court intervention ) , unless we ’ re prohibited by law or believe doing so may endanger others or cause illegal conduct .
We will object to legal requests for information about users of our services that we believe are improper .

International_Data_Transfer
Medium uses third-party vendors and hosting partners , such as Amazon , for hardware , software , networking , storage , and related technology we need to run Medium .
We maintain two types of logs : server logs and event logs .
By using the Services , you authorize Medium to transfer , store , and use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
Some of the content that you see displayed on Medium is not hosted by Medium .
These “ embeds ” are hosted by a third-party and embedded in a Medium page , so that it appears to be part of that page .
For example : YouTube or Vimeo videos , Imgur or Giphy gifs , SoundCloud audio files , Twitter tweets , GitHub code snippets , or Scribd documents that appear within a Medium post .
These files send data to the hosted site just as if you were visiting that site directly ( for example , when you load a Medium post page with a YouTube video embedded in it , that video appears because of a pointer to files hosted by YouTube , and in turn YouTube receives data about your activity , such as your IP address and how much of the video you watch ) .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
Medium doesn ’ t control what data third parties collect in cases like this , or what they ultimately do with it .
So , third-party embeds on Medium are not covered by this Privacy Policy .
They are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service ( so , when you watch a YouTube video embedded in a Medium post , the use of data about your interactions with the video would be covered by YouTube ’ s privacy policy ) .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
Some embeds may ask you for personal information , such as submitting your email address , through a form linked to from a Medium post .
We do our best to keep bad actors off of Medium .
However , if you choose to submit your information to a third party this way , we don ’ t know what they may do with it .
As explained above , their actions are not covered by this Privacy Policy .
So , please be careful when you see embedded forms on Medium asking for your email address or any other personal information .
Make sure you understand who you are submitting your information to and what they say they plan to do with it .
We suggest that you do not submit your email address or other personal information to any third-party through an embedded form .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
When posting on Medium , you may not embed a form that allows submission of personal information by users .
You must link offsite to a page that allows such submissions by users , and that page ’ s appearance must be distinct enough from Medium to ensure it does not cause confusion among users over to whom they are submitting personal information .
Failure to do so may lead Medium to disable the post or take other action to limit or disable your account .

Cookies_and_Similar_Technologies
We use browser cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you return to our Services .
We use them in various ways , for example to log you in , remember your preferences ( such as default language ) , evaluate email effectiveness , allow our paywall and meter to function , and personalize content and other services .
Without cookies , our metered paywall would not work , so they are necessary to Medium ’ s basic functionality .

Cookies_and_Similar_Technologies
Medium doesn ’ t track you across the Internet .
We track only your interactions within the Medium network ( which encompasses Medium.com and custom domains hosted by Medium ) .

Cookies_and_Similar_Technologies

Data_Security
We use encryption ( HTTPS/TLS ) to protect data transmitted to and from our site .
However , no data transmission over the Internet is 100 % secure , so we can ’ t guarantee security .
You use the Service at your own risk , and you ’ re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
If we ’ re involved in a merger , acquisition , bankruptcy , reorganization or sale of assets such that your information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy , we ’ ll notify you in advance so you can opt out of any such new policy by deleting your account before transfer .

User_Right_and_Control
Sometimes we ’ ll send you emails about your account , service changes or new policies .
You can ’ t opt out of this type of “ transactional ” email ( unless you delete your account ) .
But , you can opt out of non-administrative emails such as digests , newsletters , and activity notifications through your account ’ s Settings page .

So , the same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to HOLLA as well : Don ’ t send messages or share content that you wouldn ’ t want someone to save or share .

In September 2013 , California enacted amendments to the California Online Privacy Protection Act ( California Business & Professions Code §§22575-22579 ) which require operators of websites to disclose how they respond to “ do not track ” ( DNT ) signals from browsers used by consumers or other mechanisms that provide consumers a choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about the consumer ’ s online activities over time and across different websites or online services .
While some newer browsers have incorporated “ Do Not Track ” features which , when turned on , send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked , a DNT protocol that can be implemented across multiple devices and sites has not yet been widely adopted .
Currently , our computer system does not support , and can not act on DNT signal headers that we may receive ; accordingly , the choices that we provide you concerning out collection and use of personally identifiable information will continue to operate as described in this policy .

You don ’ t have to create an account to use some of our service features , such as searching and viewing public Twitter profiles or watching a broadcast on Periscope ’ s website .
If you do choose to create an account , you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you .
On Twitter this includes a display name ( for example , “ Twitter Moments ” ) , a username ( for example , @ TwitterMoments ) , a password , and an email address or phone number .
Your display name and username are always public , but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym .
You can also create and manage multiple Twitter accounts , for example to express different parts of your identity .

User_Right_and_Control
Most activity on Twitter is public , including your profile information , your time zone and language , when you created your account , and your Tweets and certain information about your Tweets like the date , time , and application and version of Twitter you Tweeted from .
The lists you create , people you follow and who follow you , and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public .

So are your hearts , comments , the number of hearts you ’ ve received , which accounts you are a Superfan of , and whether you watched a broadcast live or on replay .
Any hearts , comments , or other content you contribute to another account ’ s broadcast will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
In addition to providing your public information to the world directly on Twitter , we also use technology like application programming interfaces ( APIs ) and embeds to make that information available to websites , apps , and others for their use - for example , displaying Tweets on a news website or analyzing what people say on Twitter .
We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access .
We have standard terms that govern how this data can be used , and a compliance program to enforce these terms .
