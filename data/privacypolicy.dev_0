Policy_Contact_Information
Conscious Content Media Inc. ( d/b/a Learn with Homer ) located at 460 Park Avenue South , 4th Floor , NY , NY 10016 .

Policy_Introductory
This Privacy Policy sets out how we , Telegram Messenger Inc. ( “ Telegram ” ) , use and protect your personal data that you provide to us , or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us , in connection with your use of our cloud-based messaging services ( the “ Services ” ) .
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy , ‘ we ’ , ‘ us ’ and ‘ our ’ refers to Telegram , and ‘ you ’ refers to you , the user of the Services .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data : ; We do n't use your data to show you ads .
We only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service .

Specific_Audiences
If you live in a country in the European Economic Area ( EEA ) , the Services are provided by Telegram , which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services .
However , as Telegram is located outside the EEA , we have designated one of our EEA-based group companies , Telegram UK Holdings Ltd ( 71-75 Shelton Street , Covent Garden , London , England , WC2H 9JQ ) , as a representative to whom you may direct any issues you have relating to our processing of your personal data .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests ( including : ( 1 ) providing effective and innovative Services to our users ; and ( 2 ) to detect , prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of Services ) , unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
Telegram is a communication service .
You provide your mobile number and basic account data ( which may include profile name , profile picture and about information ) to create a Telegram account .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
To make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are , the screen name you choose , your profile pictures , and your username ( should you choose to set one ) on Telegram are always public .
We do n't want to know your real name , gender , age or what you like .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
We do not require your screen name to be your real name .
Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name .
This way your mother can have the public name ‘ Johnny Depp ’ while appearing as ‘ Mom ’ to you and as ‘ Boss ’ to her underlings at work ( or the other way around , depending on how these relationships are structured ) .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
When you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature , you can opt to set up a password recovery email .
This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it .
That 's right : no marketing or “ we miss you ” bullshit .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
Telegram is a cloud service .
We store messages , photos , videos and documents from your cloud chats on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups .
All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions .
This way local engineers or physical intruders can not get access to user data .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
Secret chats use end-to-end encryption .
This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know .
There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages .
We do not store your secret chats on our servers .
We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats , so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats .
For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud — you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
When you send photos , videos or files via secret chats , before being uploaded , each item is encrypted with a separate key , not known to the server .
This key and the file ’ s location are then encrypted again , this time with the secret chat ’ s key — and sent to your recipient .
They can then download and decipher the file .
This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram ’ s servers , but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient .
We don ’ t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to .
We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
In addition to private messages , Telegram also supports public channels and public groups .
All public chats are cloud chats ( see section 3.1.1 above ) .
Like everything on Telegram , the data you post in public communities is encrypted , both in storage and in transit — but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
Telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph .
We ask your permission before syncing your contacts .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
We store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications .
We only need the number and name ( first and last ) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
Our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram .
When you open the ‘ Invite friends ’ interface , we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram .

User_Right_and_Control
You can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
If you are using Android , Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs ( READ_CALL_LOG ) .
If you grant this permission , Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code .
Telegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log .

Cookies_and_Similar_Technologies
The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web .
We do not use cookies for profiling or advertising .
The cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Services , and in doing so provide you with an enhanced user experience .
Your browser should allow you to control these cookies , including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them .
You may choose to block cookies with your web browser , however , if you do disable these cookies you will not be able to log in to Telegram Web .

Data_Security
If you signed up for Telegram from the UK or the EEA , your data is stored in data centers in the Netherlands .
These are third-party provided data centers in which Telegram rents a designated space .
However , the servers and networks that sit inside these data centers and on which your personal data is stored are owned by Telegram .
As such , we do not share your personal data with such data centers .
All data is stored heavily encrypted so that local Telegram engineers or physical intruders can not get access .

Data_Security
Your messages , media and files from secret chats ( see section 3.3.2 above ) , as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your Telegram Passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient .
Before this data reaches our servers , it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient .
While Telegram servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the case of Telegram Passport data , we have no ways of deciphering the actual information .
In this case , we neither store nor process your personal data , rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we don ’ t have .

Data_Retention
Unless stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy , the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the Services .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
Telegram is a cloud service .
We will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history , including messages , media and files , to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use third-party backups or cloud storage .

Data_Security
Telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and Terms of Service violations .
Telegram also has more than 200 million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers .
To improve the security of your account , as well as to prevent spam , abuse , and other violations of our Terms of Service , we may collect metadata such as your IP address , devices and Telegram apps you 've used , history of username changes , etc .
If collected , this metadata can be kept for 12 months maximum .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
To prevent phishing , spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of Telegram ’ s Terms of Service , our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients .
If a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators , your account may be limited from contacting strangers – temporarily or permanently .
You can send an appeal using @ Spambot .
In case of more serious violations , your account may be banned .
We may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
We may use some aggregated data about how you use Telegram to build useful features .
For example , when you open the Search menu , Telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen .
To do this , we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently .
A similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu ( or when you start a new message with “ @ ” ) .
To turn this feature off and delete the relevant data , go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and disable “ Suggest Frequent Contacts ” .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
Unlike other services , we do n't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes .
Telegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and feature-rich cloud service .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
When making a purchase , you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment , and this information goes directly to the payment provider ‘ s server .
Your credit card information never reaches Telegram ’ s servers .
We do not access and do not store your credit card information .
When you save your credit card info , it is saved on the respective payment provider 's servers and the payment provider gives Telegram a token that you can reuse for future payments .
It is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
When you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order , we send it directly to the merchant bot developer .
We can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases .
We will delete this information immediately if you ask us to .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
You can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to Telegram Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and selecting ‘ Clear Payment & Shipping Info ’ .
If you choose to remove your payment information , we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
Other users of our Services with whom you choose to communicate with and share certain information , who may be located outside the EEA .
Note that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of Telegram , you are instructing us to transfer your personal data , on your behalf , to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy .
We employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures ( including encryption of your personal data ) to ensure a level of security for your personal data that is appropriate to the risk .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
We may share your personal data with : ( 1 ) our parent company , Telegram Group Inc , located in the British Virgin Islands ; and ( 2 ) Telegram FZ-LLC , a group member located in Dubai , to help provide , improve and support our Services .
We will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the security and integrity of that personal data .
This will take the form of standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission in an agreement between us and our relevant group companies .
If you would like more information regarding these clauses , please contact us using the details in section 12 below .

Third_Party_Share_and_Collection
