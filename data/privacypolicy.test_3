You don ’ t have to create an account to use some of our service features , such as searching and viewing public Twitter profiles or watching a broadcast on Periscope ’ s website .
If you do choose to create an account , you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you .
On Twitter this includes a display name ( for example , “ Twitter Moments ” ) , a username ( for example , @ TwitterMoments ) , a password , and an email address or phone number .
Your display name and username are always public , but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym .
You can also create and manage multiple Twitter accounts , for example to express different parts of your identity .

User_Right_and_Control
Most activity on Twitter is public , including your profile information , your time zone and language , when you created your account , and your Tweets and certain information about your Tweets like the date , time , and application and version of Twitter you Tweeted from .
The lists you create , people you follow and who follow you , and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public .
Periscope broadcasts you create , click on , or otherwise engage with , either on Periscope or on Twitter , are public along with when you took those actions .
So are your hearts , comments , the number of hearts you ’ ve received , which accounts you are a Superfan of , and whether you watched a broadcast live or on replay .
Any hearts , comments , or other content you contribute to another account ’ s broadcast will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope .

First_Party_Collection_and_Use
In addition to providing your public information to the world directly on Twitter , we also use technology like application programming interfaces ( APIs ) and embeds to make that information available to websites , apps , and others for their use - for example , displaying Tweets on a news website or analyzing what people say on Twitter .
We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access .
We have standard terms that govern how this data can be used , and a compliance program to enforce these terms .
But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Twitter , and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on Twitter .
